# Scheme Interpreter

This repository contains a Scheme interpreter that I developed, showcasing a profound understanding of programming language concepts, including lexical and syntactic analysis, as well as complex input parsing.

## Implemented Features
- Evaluation of symbols and invocation of built-in procedures.
- Handling of lambda expressions and procedures for anonymous functions.
- Support for named lambda procedures and definitions.
- Mu procedures enabling dynamic scope.
- Logical constructs: `if`, `and`, `or`, and `cond`.
