# Scheme-Interpreter
In this project, I have constructed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language, necessitating a deep comprehension of lexical and syntactic analysis, along with intricate input parsing skills.

I have developed features of the Scheme Interpreter, including:
- symbol evaluation, calling built-in procedures, and definitions
- Lambda procedures, using the (lambda ...) special form
- Named lambda procedures, using the (define (...) ...) special form
- Mu procedures, with dynamic scope
- Logical special forms: if, and, or, and cond
